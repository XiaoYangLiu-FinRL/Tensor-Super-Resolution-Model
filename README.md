>Tensor Sparse Coding for Generating High-granularity 3D Seismic Data      

In this paper, we propose a seismic trace interpolation method based on tensor sparse coding for 3D seismic data, that training a high-granularity dictionary and a low-granularity dictionary.<br>

## Ditionary training model
The training model for low- and high-granunarity dictionaries pair show in the figure.<br>
![model](https://github.com/hust512/Tensor-Super-Resolution-Model/blob/master/SR/Figures/0.png?raw=true)<br>
run `D_Training.m` in `SR` file for training the dictionaries pairs, get the low- and high-granularity dictionaries `Dh` and `Dl` in the file `Dictionary`. 

## Evaluation
run `Demo_seismic_SR.m` for generating high-granularity seismic data.
